A basic react native app with [`react-native-firebase`](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase) pre-integrated  to get you started quickly.

### Getting Started

Here I try to implement different functionalities - Firestore, cloud functions and notifications - as simple as it may seem integrating all those elements with react-native and other 3rd party libraries is more or less a gamble. Nevertheless the game is worth it, as in the end you recieve a fullstack application capable of many things and beign created by 1 (or not too many people) person.

### Common problems 

I have noticed that many times I recieved build errors it was simply because of faulty build process. Many times solution was to delete build from Android folder, clean and rebuild file to fire it correctly on physical device.
